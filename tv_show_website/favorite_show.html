                <span style="color: red;">Chaos Control</span>. We meet Chris when he later saves Sonic from drowning in his pool and <br>

                use them to get back to their world, but Doctor Robotnik wants them for himself to take <br>
                over Earth. Sonic isn't in as much of a rush to get back and would rather explore Earth.

            <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
            <p style="color: blue;">
                I believe that this show was pretty good and I had fun watching it. The story was <br>
                pretty well written and the characters were all enjoyable. It didn't seem too far off <br>
                from the sonic lore and the show as a whole had its own unique charm to it.
