            <h2>Show Info</h2>
            <h3>Main Characters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sonic The Hedgehog</li>
                <li>Chris Thorndyke</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Plot</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <span>Sonic, his friends, and Doctor Robotnik</span> are teleported to Earth due to an accidental <br>
                    <span>Chaos Control</span>. We meet <span>Chris</span> when he later saves Sonic from drowning in his pool and <br>
                    they become friends. Sonic's other friends now want to retrieve all the <span>chaos emeralds</span> to <br>
                    use them to get back to their world, but Doctor Robotnik wants them for himself to take <br>
                    over Earth. Sonic isn't in as much of a rush to get back and would rather explore Earth.

            <h3>Personal Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    I believe that this show was pretty good and I had fun watching it. The story was <br>
                    pretty well written and the characters were all enjoyable. It didn't seem too far off <br>
                    from the sonic lore and the show as a whole had its own unique charm to it.

                    <dt>Sonic the Hedgehog</dt>
                    <dd>A cool and funny daredevil that cares about his friends and will do what he<br>
                        can to protect them. He loves <span>chilidogs</span> and long runs. He'll also travel around the world to<br>
                        admire all the different sights there are to see. He likes making new friends and has been<br>
                        <span>enemies with Doctor Robotnik</span> for a long time.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Chris Thorndyke</dt>
                    <dd>A calm <span>human boy</span> that befriends Sonic after <span>saving him</span> and getting to know<br>
                        him better. He's well-mannered, but also enjoys a bit of adventure. Sometimes he gets<br>
                        into a bit of trouble when going on adventures, though.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Tails (Miles Prower)</dt>
                    <dd>A smart and kind tech-savvy who is Sonic's best friend. He makes a lot of inventions and even<br>
                        has his own airplane called the <span>Tornado</span>. The difference between his machines and Dr. Robotniks'<br>
                        is that Tails uses them for good. On a side note, Tails can even use <span>his twin tails</span> like propellors,<br>
                        so that he can <span>fly</span>.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Knuckles</dt>
                    <dd>An obstinate and short tempered echidna who's the last of an <span>ancient tribe</span> of<br>
                        other echidnas. He guards the <span>Master Emerald</span>, which is a giant mystical emerald<br>
                        that has the power to control the <span>seven chaos emeralds</span>. Knuckles believes that everyone<br>
                        has good in them and can change, but that also leads to him being very naive.

                    <dt>Doctor Robotnik</dt>
                    <dd>An evil mastermind that's very power hungry and will use his inventions to<br>
                        gain that power. He'll also try to manipulate others, such as <span>Knuckles</span>,<br>
                        to get them on his side to have even more control. He's the main antagonist.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Shadow the Hedgehog</dt>
                    <dd>A cold and aggressive lonewolf that's not very social and doesn't let anyone or anything stand in<br> 
                        his way. He believes that he is the <span>"Ultimate Lifeform"</span> and tends to see others as being beneathe<br>
                        him, but he does have people that he does truly care about like <span>Maria and Rouge.</span>
